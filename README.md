# Task 

The objective is to be able to:

a) Observe the series 

b) Indeitify the most likely linear stochastic process difining the series 

c) Forecast the next month of data


# Procedure

a) Plotly express line graph 

b) Plotly line graph for the PACF Function

c) Plotly express line graph 


# Interesting parts

The most complex part has been adding the sidebar and replicating the them, which at the beggining seemed difficult but it's not at all. The project is not too complicated, but it does exactly what I want, so it's fully designed by myself (Of course inspired Dash documentation).
